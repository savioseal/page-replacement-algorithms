# page-replacement-algorithms
Operating Systems mini-project for page replacement algorithms

This is the mini-project for Operating Systems course at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. We were tasked to write program that sorts pages using page replacement algorithms.
My project includes FIFO and LRU algorithms.
